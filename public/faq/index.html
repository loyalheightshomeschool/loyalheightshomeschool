<label for=question1>What is LHH?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>Loyal Heights Homeschool Program (LHH) is a quasi-cooperative community of homeschooling families who gather each week in the Loyal Heights neighborhood of Seattle for classes, play, and community. LHH is led by a committee of parent volunteers who develop the class schedule and help organize events for the families of the LHH community. We partner with the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department who helps administer our program by hosting the registration system and providing the location for most of our classes. Classes run on a quarterly schedule in the fall, winter, and spring.</p></div></div><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question2>
<label for=question2>Is LHH right for me?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>If you are a homeschooling family in Seattle looking for in-person community and/or classes, you are welcome to join. We are a non-denominational, non-sectarian, non-discriminating group of homeschooling families interested in providing our families the opportunity to develop friendships and learn together in a supportive, multi-age environment. While we are not technically a co-op, we expect families to contribute in some way as they are able. There are opportunities for both long term and short term volunteer jobs, from developing the program of classes to moving tables and chairs, from managing our website to tidying up the lobby at the end of the day.</p></div></div><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question3>

We aim to respond within 3-5 days.</p><p>Joining will involve meeting or talking to someone first, in order to maintain the safety and privacy of our families. Once we’ve verified that you are a real human, interested in or currently homeschooling in the Seattle area, you are eligible to join the LHH Google Group, LHH Facebook Group, and Seattle Homeschool Group (SHG) network.

<label for=question6>What is the LHH Committee?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>The LHH Committee is a group of parent volunteers who plan and run the LHH Program.

<label for=question7>How do I register for classes?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>Registration typically starts 4 to 6 weeks before the start of the upcoming quarter. The LHH Committee will send reminders through our Facebook Group, and Google Group to spread the word about registering. Classes can fill quickly, so it is best to register early. In cases of low enrollment, classes may be canceled up to two weeks before the session begins. For the sake of the teachers and other students, please try to register early!</p><p>There are three ways to register for classes:</p><ol><li><strong>Online:</strong> Visit the <a href="https://anc.apm.activecommunities.com/seattle/activity/search?activity_select_param=2&center_ids=24&activity_keyword=homeschool&viewMode=list" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Parks and Recreation website</a></li><li><strong>By phone:</strong> Call the Loyal Heights Community Center at (206) 684-4052.</li><li><strong>In person:</strong> Go to any Seattle Community Center and register in person at the front desk.</li></ol><p><strong>Sibling Discounts:</strong> There is a $5 discount per additional sibling signed up for the same class.</p></div></div><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question8>
<label for=question8>Are there scholarships?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>Seattle Parks and Recreation offers scholarships for qualifying families. Applications are available starting in the June of the following school year. You can apply at any time and your scholarship will apply to all classes for the rest of the school year.</p><p>The primary income-earner in your household is the person who should fill out the application. Although their website states that you can apply at any community center or pool, past experience by LHH families has shown that the fastest way to get approved is in person at the Loyal Heights Community Center. Make sure you have all the necessary documents with you. The primary applicant should bring their completed application, photo ID and all required income and dependency documentation. It is beneficial to list all dependents, including babies, even if you are not planning on enrolling them in classes.</p><p>If you wish to use funds to register for classes, you must be approved PRIOR to registering. Approval can take up to several weeks. Applying early helps ensure you will get the funds, if you are eligible. Sometimes, they do not have enough funds to meet the demand and in those instances, scholarships are granted on a first come, first served basis.</p><p>Visit the <a href=https://www.seattle.gov/parks/scholarships-and-financial-aid target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Seattle Parks and Recreation website</a> for eligibility guidelines, application form, and other information.</p></div></div><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question9>
<label for=question9>Can my child register for classes if they are outside the stated age range?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p><strong>Community Center classes:</strong> Students outside the age range need teacher approval. Teachers make the age variance policy for their classes. If approved, the teacher lets the community center staff know the full name of the student and the parent will need to register the student in person or by calling the Loyal Heights Community Center at (206) 684-4052. Online registration will not allow age variances.</p><p><strong>Offsite classes:</strong> Each of our partners who offer classes offsite will have their own policies. Please check directly with them.</p></div></div><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question10>
<label for=question10>Are there waitlists for classes that are full?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>If a class is full, a waitlist will be started. If space becomes available, you will be notified and can register at that time by phone or in person. In some cases, class limits may be expanded, and withdrawals do occasionally occur.</p></div></div><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question11>
<label for=question11>I changed my mind and want to withdraw from a class I’ve signed up for. Can I get a refund?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p><strong>Community Center classes:</strong> A refund is available if a student drops the class before the second class.

<label for=question12>What is your Health and Safety Policy?<div class=open>▼</div><div class=close>▲</div></label><div class=answer><p>At LHH, we use a combination of approaches to help keep our program safe and accessible to all our families.</p><p><strong>Stay home when sick:</strong> As much as we love to be together, we ask that people stay home when symptomatic with a viral infection. For guidance, see these <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target=_blank href=https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html>CDC Guidelines</a></p><p><strong>Masks are optional:</strong> While masks are not required at the community center, please respect those who choose to wear one. If you see someone wearing a mask, consider they may: have unvaccinated family members, feel ill and not want to get you sick, be immuno-compromised, have high-risk loved ones, or prefer to wear a mask. Please be kind and respect everyone’s choice. The community center has a supply of adult size masks available for use.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> We would like our program to be accessible to as much of the community as possible, but LHH families should know that the community center is a mask-optional facility that is open to the public daily. Other activities, such as preschools, weight room, and after school programs take place within the building at the same time as our program. Some members feel more comfortable hanging out outdoors at the playground, grass, or playfields. We hope you will feel welcome either indoors or out.</p></div></div></div><h3 id=for-the-parents class=faq-heading>For the Parents</h3><div class=questionsAnswers><div class=faq><input class=question type=checkbox id=question13>
